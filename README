This plugin for the TypeScript compiler allows the user to save the syntax tree
of a given program in an XML format. The XML corresponds exactly to the tree 
that the compiler creates, so it might not work correctly in a malformed program.


##CONFIGURATION:
1. Checkout this repository (say in folder cse199-code-0).

2. Go to the folder cse199-code-0.

3. Clone the typescript repository (git) or create a folder called "typescript" and copy 
the content of the git repository (download the zip and extract it there).
 The repo is in: http://typescript.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#README.txt

Your file system should look like this:
cse199-code-0
-rwxr-xr-x 1  applypatch
drwxr-xr-x 2  bin
-rw-r--r-- 1  Makefile
-rw-r--r-- 1  README
-rwxr-xr-x 1  run
drwxr-xr-x 2  src
drwxr-xr-x 2  tests
drwxr-xr-x 8  typescript

4. Install node.js and tsc.
   4.1 Install node.js:
       This runs JavaScript code outside of any browser. 
       http://nodejs.org/
       Make sure that the command "node" works on the terminal.
	   If you dont, create a link (ln -s) in /usr/local/bin in to
	   the node script (which is in the folder where you installed it).   
   4.2 Install tsc:
       After 4.1, you have the npm utility to install new js code.
       The command npm might not be available, but the npm script is
       in the folder where you installed node.js, in node-v0.10.20/deps/npm/bin/npm
       Execute npm install -g typescript
	   Make sure you have the "tsc" command in the terinal, otherwise, do the same
	   thing as in 4.1.

5. Apply the patch:
 Go to cse199-code-0
 run: ./applypatch

##RUNNING

6. Build the project
